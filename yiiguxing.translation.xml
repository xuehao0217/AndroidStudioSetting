      <item value="Finally we consider the view valid if the layout parameter size is set to wrap_content. It's difficult for Glide to figure out what to do here. Although Target.SIZE_ORIGINAL is a coherent choice, it's extremely dangerous because original images may be much too large to fit in memory or so large that only a couple can fit in memory, causing OOMs. If users want the original image, they can always use .override(Target.SIZE_ORIGINAL). Since wrap_content may never resolve to a real size unless we load something, we aim for a square whose length is the largest screen size. That way we're loading something and that something has some hope of being downsampled to a size that the device can support. We also log a warning that tries to explain what Glide is doing and why some alternatives are preferable. Since WRAP_CONTENT is sometimes used as a default layout parameter, we always wait for layout to complete before using this fallback parameter (ConstraintLayout among others)." />
